                                As Foundations Director I managed all campaign logistics, analytics, and reporting, while growing a capable team of emloyees and volunteers to consistenlty exceed 
                                campaing fundraising and petition goals. I was solely responsible for the accurate and timely reporting of all regional campaing fincials, and learned skills in 
                                data driven strategic field planning from long time industry experts. Durring my time with COPIRG and <a href='https://publicinterestnetwork.org/'>The Public interest Group</a> 
                                I consistenlty recruited, trained, and supervised teams over 30 capable, motivated, and enthusiastic employees, and countless more volunteers. Having honed my skills in persuasive communication, 
                                I found myself drawn more and more to the data that drove the our stretegic decisions, and backed our most powerful arguments.

                                    <p class = 'text-uppercase'>Inroduction</p>
                                    <p> The goal of this project was to explore applications of Latent Dirichlet Allocations 
                                        and Simple Sentiment Analysis in targeted issues based policy campaigns. The issue I chose 
                                        as a demonstration of these methods is that of homelessness. The dataset created for this 
                                        project is composed of user posts and comments scrapped from the social media site Nextdoor.com. 
                                        The size of the dataset was limited by a lack of volunteer accounts in varied regions of Denver, 
                                        and a limitation in accessing historical data from the source. The final size of the dataset 
                                        before post-scrape and pre-preprocessing and cleaning, was just above 1,000 posts and 15,000 comments. 
                                        The goal was to apply LDA in order to correlate the sentiment of user posts with their topical 
                                        content. Below is an example of our models final output for the broad topic of homelessness nearly as envisioned.</p>
                                  
                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/Authors.png" alt="..." />

                                    <p>Next-door has no public API that we could find. Their web interface is also Javascript heavy making selenium our 
                                        preferred choice of web scraping library for this application. Next-door provides a unique source of textual data 
                                        to other social media sources in several ways. First, users are required to register their physical 
                                        address with legal documentation, providing a greatly increased confidence in the accuracy of recorder 
                                        user geographies. Second, users' access to content is restricted by geography in a way intended to stimulate 
                                        discussions among neighborhood community members, creating a unique virtual landscape full of content pertaining 
                                        to local issues. Unlike other social media outlets, next-doors UIX , or perhaps just their stated mission, seem to 
                                        influence users to provide standard and correctly spelled textual data to a far greater degree than is common with 
                                        Twitter or Reddit for example. Next-door also does not limit the number of characters per post, and so 
                                        posts are significantly longer on average. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>LDA is an unsupervised machine learning model that allows us to extract descriptive topics 
                                        from textual data. Dirichlet’s are distributions of multinomial distributions represented 
                                        as simplexes. LDA uses two of these distributions , one to represent the distribution of words to topics, 
                                        and the other of topics to words. There are few things our model will need from us before training.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Number of expected topics</li>
                                            <li>Alpha - number of expected topics per document</li>
                                            <li>Beta - number of words expected to define each topic</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        The desired output is a list of human readable topics defined both by their most frequently occurring and most relevant terms.
                                    </p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/final_model.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p>PyLDAvis is a useful library with a singular purpose, the visualization of unsupervised topic 
                                        models. Below is a pyLDAvis example consisting of the result of our homelessness content modeling. 
                                        Topic 1 highlighted in red in actual topic index 0. On the right are the words of which the topic 
                                        is composed. The five most relevant topic terms for topic 0 are help, homeless, need, donate, shelter. 
                                        From this it is left to the modeler to interpret how to define or classify the topic label. In this 
                                        example, I labeled topic 0 as “Homeless - Donations and Shelter”, because their are several topics in our 
                                        dataset pertaining to different aspects of homelessness that we are interested in several of our topic will 
                                        bare the prefix “Homeless” and irrelevant topics should be filtered out by being assigned Misc. as their label.This can be done with a simple python dictionary. </p>
                                    
                                    <p class = 'text-uppercase'>Preprocessing</p>
                                    <p>For topic modeling my dataset I decided to use all post and comment data for training input. 
                                        I constructed my data frame so that each comment has an id# which pertains 
                                        to its originating post. Imagine an example when a post's comments take the topic of 
                                        discussion far from where it began. This happens very often in social media forums. 
                                        We don’t want our pipeline to misrepresent the relationship between the emotional content 
                                        of a post's comments, and the topic of the post, so we include all post and comment data in 
                                        our LDA corpus. While this may mean that our topics appear less applicable to their specific 
                                        posts, they should apply more coherently with the user dialogue encompassed by the post and 
                                        comments combined.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The most significant of the benefits to come from a week's labour building a web scraper was the 
                                        quality and cleanliness with which text was pulled into my initial data frame. I had no line breaks 
                                        to manage, minimal misspellings, and no html tags to clean. I still had to de-accent , lowercase, and inspect 
                                        for token misspellings and acronyms. Something I failed to utilize here was the functionality offered by NLTK’s multiword 
                                        expression tokenizer, which allows for the creation of custom word grams. Using MWE I would focus on domain specific compound 
                                        words and acronyms in order to better inform my model.   
                                        <br><br>
                                        I chose to reduce some of the complexity of the corpus through lemmatization, and by focusing on parts of speech likely to inform the 
                                        topic of the text. For example, conjunctions largely do nothing to inform the topic of a conversation. Since LDA will define our topics 
                                        by the most frequently occurring and relevant terms, we don’t want it getting confused by terms like, ‘and’, ‘but’, ’to’, and others. 
                                        On the other hand, while next-door content is longer on average than that of twitter, I was still dealing with what would be classified as 
                                        short text ( primarily under 150 words ). This being the case, I wanted to refrain from excessively reducing the vocabulary of the corpus. 
                                        To balance these two concerns, nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs were all used in our final topic modeling process.

                                    <p>Tuning LDA models presents challenges because of its unsupervised nature, and because we are dealing with subjective interpretations 
                                        of  textual data. In this context we don’t have a metric to optimize for, and the metrics we use to evaluate topic models 
                                        don’t really provide insight into the human readability or application of the topical output. Coherence is a measure 
                                        of the semantic similarity between high scoring words within a single topic. This can help us determine which topics are interpretable 
                                        and topics that are merely byproducts of statistical inference. Log perplexity is a measure of the degree to which your model is confused 
                                        by new data. Here a lower well below 0 is desirable, but again we see that this doesn’t measure the actual interpretability of our topics, 
                                        for now, we still need a human for that.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Here is one of several of my creative attempts to visualize model tuning results.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/tunning_results_2-6_topics.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p>The best place to start is by considering the distribution of your topics and words to topics. 
                                        Are the uniform or asymmetrical? For my content, I deduced that since our posts varied quite 
                                        distinctly in length that the number of words in each post which retained to its topic would vary 
                                        significantly, and also that some of my topics would not have the same number of words to define them 
                                        semantically as others ( example: [cat, dog, pet ],[homeless, shelter, volunteer, donate, zoning]) with 
                                        this assumption we expected our model to perform better with the Gensim preset of ‘asymmetrical’ for the beta 
                                        parameter. For alpha, I deduced that the short text and social media orgigins of the text data implied that 
                                        each document likely contained few, if not just one topic per document. 
                                        This too proved to be a useful deduction, as our final alpha parameter was 0.15.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Returning to the hyper parameters I mentioned earlier, Alpha, Beta, and N_topics, I want to add that chunk size, or the 
                                        number of randomly selected documents to include in each successive model training iteration, similar to batch size in 
                                        tensorflow and keras libraries. When working with data other than textual data, the final selection of batch size is often 
                                        the result of a compromise between computational energy usage(ex. image data ) and the overall size of ones dataset 
                                        ( risk : overfitting ).In the case of textual data I found that it the selection of chunk size has a distinctly noticeable 
                                        effect on model output. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        I suggest that other practitioners consider the size of their individual  documents, the degree of 
                                        similarity/dissimilarity of lexicon from document to document in randomly selected samples. For example, 
                                        while training our topic model, we found a small chunk size, and an increased number of training passes to be ideal for 
                                        clarity of model output. Chunksizes less than 60 consistently produced more coherent topics 
                                        while chunk sizes greater than 60 consistently confused the target topic of homelessness with other content. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class = 'text-uppercase'>Conclusions</p>
                                    <p> While I am happy with that data procured from Next-door, a lack of volunteers and restrictions on searching historical data created a 
                                        shortage of relevant content to work with that caused significant difficulties throughout. Most problematically , I was unable to remove a 
                                        sufficient number of stop words from the corpus to sufficiently clarify the output topics due to the limited size of the model vocabulary.
                                        <br><br>
                                        LDA on its own is a powerful tool to provide insight into the topical content of textual data, however, it has limitations 
                                        on short text that I plan to address in future iterations through the application of Gibbs sampling 
                                        methods. IDA2vec word embeddings would allow our model to utilize bidirectional word embeddings to inform each 
                                        topic as well. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        The results of our model do many accurate classification labels, but with too many inaccuracies to really on for the creation of a labeled dataset. 
                                        To say nothing of the limitations of simple sentiment analysis, the application of which would require creation of a domain specific word count dictionary. 
                                        The output of an LDA model without Gibbs sampling seems to be insufficient for reliable use in targeted campaigns , but a fast 
                                        and easy way to become familiar with the general content of a large corpus.
